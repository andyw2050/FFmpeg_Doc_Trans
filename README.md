FFmpeg_Doc_Trans
================

Make Chinese compute vision developers understand and use ffmpeg easily.
I know it is a new start for who love cv technology in videos processing and encode,decode.
So i decided to give ffmpeg document translation at first step, and then other useful works will
be done.
Details works arrangement as follows:
1)Document translation.

2)Source codes analysis.

3)Take some easy examples for programmers in how to use ffmpeg to develop a vedio/audio player.

4)Try to fix some bugs and give more affords for ffmpeg.

Ps:
    Please keep your codes and any commits in UTF-8 format, it will give me less mess work to gether your commits.
Thanks from EK.
